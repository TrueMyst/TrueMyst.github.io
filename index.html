            Good day! Myst here. Mystie is my internet alias, so you may already be familiar with me. I'm a student and a
            self-taught developer. I began learning software development in the year 2020, when everyone was attempting to
            make the most of their lockdown time by engaging on fancy, productive work.
            <br><br>
            Discord Bots alone increased my interest in software development. The way the bots worked fascinated me. That
            greatly helped my career development because I learnt a lot about Python, and I plan to learn even more in the
            future.
            <br><br>
            Web development is another field in which I'm interested. You may have noticed how straightforward and basic
            this website is. That's because I just began learning about web development. It will keep getting better as time
            passes.
